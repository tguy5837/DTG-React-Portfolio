# Taylor's React Portfolio

## Description

I am a UNC Coding Bootcamp student looking to break into an incredibly interesting field that will allow me to assist in solving real world problems.

This page is intended to serve not only as a display of my best work but also a place where employers and other potential clients may learn more about me and be able to get in contact with me.

This project was developed using React which improves the performance of the application as well as showcasing my ability to leverage new technologies that are gaining popularity in the industry.
